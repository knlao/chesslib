# chesslib

A Java Chess Library (unfinished)

## Current Features

- Basic chess rules (apart from draw detection)
- Include JavaDoc

## To be added

- Draw detection
- Formal move notation (such as "Ncxe4" instead of "c5 e4")
- FEN and PGN (read and export)
- Move history
- Graphical User Interface
- Artificial intelligent (if I have time)

### This is a WIP
